# Create a Staff User

## Overview

When a new staff member joins The Seattle School, a user profile must be created for this person. First, the user is added to Active Directory. From there, a Google Sync is run to create a Google account for the user and set them up with access to email. Finally, alias and delegate email access is added for the users that need it.
